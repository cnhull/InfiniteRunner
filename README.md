For our endless runner, we wanted to create a somewhat therapeutic experience in contrast to the typically anxiety-inducing games found in this format. In order to create this peaceful ambiance and maintain a consistent visual style, our team made all of the artwork used in the game (sans music). The design of the background and the main character went through several iterations, with each one bringing us closer to our desired visual effect. We also made a simple but effective animation for the character sprite, which is something that we didnâ€™t have much experience with prior to this project. 

Some of the aspects were technically challenging-- You might notice that the title of our game is Falling Snow... but there isn't actually any snow falling. We were hoping to figure out how the particle emitter works, but ultimately had to prioritize the gameplay over aesthetic flair. However, we still tried to venture into unknown waters-- trying to figure out regular intervals for an uspecified amount of time was certainly a challenge. Trying to convey in the most efficient way that you ran into something that you shouldn't have, we tossed around a lot of ideas, and wound up scoping down to what was effective, and the least time consuming. I think we did a good job at slowly scaling up the difficulty so that it doesn't get much harder until you're ready for it.
